/*Consider a scenario where an interface named ‘Animal’ is in
package named ‘animalpackage ’ and it declares two methods ‘get_cries’
and ‘get_eating_type’ that are place holders for printing cry and eating
type of animals. The subpackages of ‘animalpackage ’ are ‘herbivorous
’and ‘carnivorous’. The ‘herbivorous’ package contain two classes ‘cow’
and ‘elephant’ that implements the ‘Animal’ interface.Similarly the
‘carnivorous’ package contain ‘lion’ and ‘bear’ that too implements the
interface. Design a main class that import these classes and invokes the
corresponding methods.*/
